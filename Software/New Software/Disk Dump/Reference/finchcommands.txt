DMA Command String
(Finch has 29 Sectors per track, 605 tracks per disk, 4 disks)

81 -> Unit Select, followed by one byte (0, 2, 4, 8)
84 -> Disk Select, followed by one byte (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
82 -> RTZ (skip when doing consecutive reads)
83 -> Seek, followed by two bytes (X'0000' ~ X'025C')
8A -> Read, followed by three bytes (X'00' and X'0190' in DIAG?)
    First byte: Sector (00 ~ 1D)
    Next two bytes: Number of bytes to read (X'0190')
FF -> Command string needs to finish with FF

Example command for reading Unit 01, Disk 00, Track 00, Sector 00
81 02 84 00 83 00 00 8A 00 01 90 FF

To DMA string out

DMA SCT,XXXX -> How many bytes to read in command string (FFFF - count)
DMA SAD,XXXX -> Where to start reading bytes from
DMA SDV,3?   -> Set DMA device to 3?
DMA EAB      -> Enable DMA
43           -> Send command. Must be stored into X'F800'?
* Wait for FFC status bit to confirm done *
DMA SCT,XXXX -> How many bytes will be read over DMA (FFFF - count)
DMA SAD,XXXX -> Where to store the read bytes to
DMA EAB      -> Enable DMA
45           -> Execute command. Must be stored into X'F800'?
