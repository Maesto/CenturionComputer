C: ???
	When at main prompt, it just gives another prompt
	Typing a number or letters printed parts of the file
	Up to a certain point, where it just said "EOF on Input"	

E: End of File
	When at main prompt, it asks "End of File? (Y or N)"
	No clue what this means, potentially cursor position related?

F: Find
	When at main prompt, it asks "Find? (Y or N)"
	Hit enter then it gives a second prompt
	That's as far as I've gotten
	
I: ???
	When at main prompt, it gives a second prompt
	No matter what I type there, it says "Equality not Found"
	No clue what this means

J: SYS number?
	When at main prompt, it asks "'SYS' Number?"
	Enter the right number then it asks "Subfile"
	Enter the wrong input and it aborts
	That's as far as I've gotten

K: Write New Text
	Type the last line of the edit, hit enter
	Then type everything that comes before last line
	Type last line of edit again, hit enter
	Editing an existing file adds the edit before the existing text
	It does not overwrite

N: ???
	Typing anything says "EOF on Input"
	This could be a result of previous operations?

O: Output
	When at main prompt it asks the following
	"Continuous forms?" (Answer Y or N)
	"Inserts?" (Answer Y or N)
	"Enter copies" (Answer with a number)
	"Enter starting page" (Answer with a number)
	"Console display?"  (Answer Y or N)
	"Wait?"  (Answer Y or N)
	"Align forms, type CR"  (Answer Y or N)
	It then prints out the currently opened file and scrolls past
	This might be for printing on an external printer?
	
P: Print current line
	When at main prompt, it gives a second prompt
	Typing a number or letters printed parts of the file
	Up to a certain point, where it just said "EOF on Input"
	
S: Substitute
	When at main prompt, it gives a second prompt
	Type a word in this prompt, hit enter
	Gives a third prompt to type a word in
	Somehow you can finish the substitution setup
	It then asks "Wait?"  (Answer Y or N)
	It then says "Substitutions = 0" (or number of substitutions)
	I haven't been able to get this to work right yet
	
T: Top
	When at main prompt, it asks "Top? (Y or N)"
	No clue what this means, potentially cursor position related?

U: Refresh program?
	When at main prompt, it says "IN=SYS000, OUT=SYS001"
	This is what it says when the program first opens
	So maybe this refreshes back to standard prompt?
