date of death, and two acknowledged to names and addresses.
The memorial number may be the same as the number used in the CHURCH application, but can be any unique number from 1 to 9999.
The name should be entered so that it can be sorted alphabetically (i.e. last name, first name, middle name).^^

^M9 65
^^This option allows the operator to enter the memorial transactions.^^

^^The operator enters the
memorial number (the memorial should be set up in the MEMORIAL NAME FILE first), and the computer will display the memorial
name.  The operator enters who the check is from, their address and the designation code.
The computer will display the code name.
The operator then enters the amount given and date given (or deposited).
The computer displays the two acknowledgement names and the operator keys in the name the gift was acknowledged to
and the acknowledgement date.  The operator then hits
newline and the computer generates a unique key for this record in the MEMORIAL MASTER FILE.  The key will be displayed and SHOULD
be followed by a blank.  If a name is displayed, the operator should increase
the value of the newline field (i.e. from 1 to 2, etc.) until the unique key field is followed by a blank.  This insures that there
will be a unique key in the MEMORIAL MASTER FILE when the transactions are posted.  Also, there should not be any duplicate keys on
the print-out of the MEMORIAL TRANSACTION FILE.  The unique key is the memorial number followed by 01-99.  If all the possible keys
are used, the operator can assign another memorial number  in the MEMORIAL NAME FILE.^^

and the unique key and duplicate key from the MEMORIAL MASTER FILE.
