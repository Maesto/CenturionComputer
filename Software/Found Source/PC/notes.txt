                              SOFTRAN NOTES

THE CRT PORT WHICH IS TO USED AS THE COMMUNICATIONS LINE SHOULD HAVE A CRT
KEY-AHEAD BUFFER OF AT LEAST 128 CHARACTERS.

THE JCL PC.CENTURION IS SET UP TO RUN IN A PARTITION WITH CRT#V BEING THE
CONNECTED TO THE IBM-PC.

THE JCL PC.SOFTERM IS SET UP TO RUN IN A PARTITION ASSIGNED TO CRT#V BUT WITH
A DIFFERENT CRT AS THE COMMUNICATIONS LINE. THIS PROGRAM WILL ASK IF YOU WANT
TO RUN SOFTRAN AS A MASTER PROGRAM (TO COMMUNICATE TO ANOTHER CENTURION) OR AS
THE MONITOR (TO COMMUNICATE TO AN IBM-PC).

AT THIS TIME THERE ARE STILL SOME BUGS IN COMMUNICATING BETWEEN 2 CENTURIONS.

A DIRECTORY FEATURE HAS BEEN ADDED TO PC.CENTURION.  IF AT ANY TIME THE 'READY'
PROMPT IS ON THE SCREEN AND THE 'D' KEY IS PRESSED, THEN THE MESSAGE 'DIR OF:'
WILL APPEAR.  THE GENERAL FORM IS:
                    [LNAME.] D
                              WHERE LNAME. IS A 1 TO TEN CHARACTER LIBRARY NAME
                                    D IS THE DISK VOLUME OF THE DIRECTORY

IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT A 'DIAL' COMMAND WITHOUT A PHONE NUMBER SHOULD BE RUN
BEFORE A 'SEND' OR 'RECEIVE' COMMAND TO CORRECTLY INITIALIZE THE COM PORT.
